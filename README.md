## Description

This website was built to complete the "[Project: Restaurant Page](https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/full-stack-javascript/courses/javascript/lessons/restaurant-page)" from the [Javascript course](https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/full-stack-javascript/courses/javascript) of [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/) curriculum. The objective is to become familiar with ES6 Modules and Webpack and use JavaScript alone to generate the entire website's content.
